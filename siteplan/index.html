        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>My purpose for this site is to specialize in organic, locally grown foods. The company sells fruits and
            produce directly from the farmers in the area, but also uses some national and international suppliers. The
            owner-operated company caters to walk in traffic at their storefront in Carlsbad and, of course, their food
            trucks. They deliver and manage those orders on the phone and via the website. The mission is to provide
            fresh and healthy food options, including organic, made to order, fruit drinks and fruit bags, to the local
            population and to tourists visiting the coastal areas.</p>
