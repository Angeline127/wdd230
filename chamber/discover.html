                <p>Kumasi is the main city of Ashanti-Kwahu region of Ghana. Kumasi is considered the home of the
                    Ashanti
                    King, the current one being Otumfuo Osei Tutu II. Kumasi is widely regarded as the cultural cradle
                    of
                    Ghana as the vibrancy of Ghana's culture is more evident here than any part of the country. The
                    Asantehene still sits in state as Ashantis from all walks of life pay homage. He even presides over
                    traditional courts and some residents use this instead of the judicial system</p>
